# Project name

WTWR

# Functionality

This site is designed to determine what clothes are suitable to wear with what weather temp.

# Technologies used

Npm, react, jsx, js, html & css. I also used external hardware to make this easier to do by using two screens!

# Plans to improve project

I am having trouble getting the header__modal-button to work right, I would love to get some feedback on it if I can, I tried using space-between while creating another div and that did not work.
